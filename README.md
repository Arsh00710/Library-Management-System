LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


This project outlines the development of a Library Management System designed to streamline library operations through a relational database. The system manages information on library branches, staff, books, patrons, and book circulation (borrowing and returns). This centralized approach empowers librarians to efficiently handle tasks like book inventory, customer interactions, and staff scheduling, ultimately boosting overall library effectiveness.

We'll delve into the project step-by-step, exploring each component:

Database Creation:

Begin by creating a database named 'library'.

Tables Creation:

Create a table named 'Branch' to store information about library branches.

Create a table named 'Employee' to contain details of library staff.

Create a table named 'Books' to store information about the books available in the library.

Create a table named 'Customer' to contain details of library customers.

Create a table named 'IssueStatus' to track books issued to customers.

Create a table named 'ReturnStatus' to track books returned by customers.


Inserting Data:

Insert data into each table to populate them with initial information, including branch details, employee information, book details, customer details, and records of issued and returned books.
SQL Queries:

Retrieve available books with their titles, categories, and rental prices.
List employee names and salaries in descending order of salary.
Retrieve book titles and the customers who have issued those books.
Display the total count of books in each category.
Retrieve employee names and positions for those with salaries above Rs. 50,000.
List customer names who registered before a certain date and have not issued any books.
Display branch numbers and the total count of employees in each branch.
Display customer names who issued books in a specific month.
Retrieve book titles containing the word "history".
Retrieve branch numbers with a count of employees for branches having more than 5 employees.

Conclusion:

The Library Management System project underscores the significance and efficacy of employing a relational database to oversee library operations. By centralizing and organizing library information, the system streamlines resource management, enhances customer service, and augments decision-making processes for library staff. The provided SQL queries furnish indispensable tools for accessing and analyzing library data, empowering librarians to optimize operations, enrich user experiences, and ultimately bolster the library's efficacy as a pivotal educational and community asset. Each query serves a specific function, be it retrieving data, refining results, or aggregating information, thereby furnishing insights into the library system. In sum, this project illustrates the creation of a relational database for managing library operations encompassing book inventory, customer interactions, and employee administration, complemented by an array of SQL queries to derive meaningful insights from the database.
